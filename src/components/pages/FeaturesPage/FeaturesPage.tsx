          Apache Pulsar server - the Broker - does not persist a received message to a file on the local disk. Instead, it writes the message to another system called Apache Bookkeeper - which can be shortly described as a distributed (multiple nodes) append-only virtual-file storage. The message is written to such append-only virtual file, a.k.a. Ledger. This design makes Pulsarâ€™s broker stateless; hence upon sudden surge in traffic, it can scale out in seconds - adding more nodes and spreading the topics among them automatically (see load balancer feature below), without any data movement needed in Pulsar.
          A topic is, in fact, a list of ledgers (virtual append-only files). The active ledger is closed each configurable size/time, and a new one is opened and used.
          Apache Bookkeeper can also scale out in seconds. When adding nodes, no data movement is required. Since actively written topics keep replacing their active ledger, the new bookkeeper nodes are also selected, as part of a uniform selection process to host new files, hence balancing out the message writes. This means the new nodes help balance the high surge of traffic immediately.

                <p>In order, by key. You can have as many consumers as needed concurrently. The broker divides the keys equally between the consumers, and all messages for a particular key will arrive at the same single consumer associated with that key. This preserves the ordering of message processing by key.</p>
